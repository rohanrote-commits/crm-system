💻 COMPLETE STEP-BY-STEP WORKFLOW
🧱 STEP 1: Make sure your repo is up to date

Before you start coding:

git fetch origin
git checkout main
git pull origin main


Now your local main matches the remote main.

🔀 STEP 2: Move to your feature branch

If your branch already exists:

git checkout user-management


If not, create it from main:

git checkout -b user-management


This branch is where you’ll write your code.

📝 STEP 3: Edit / Add your code

Open your project in your IDE (like IntelliJ, VS Code, etc.)
Make your changes — for example:

Add new files

Modify existing code

Delete unnecessary code

Let’s say you edited:
UserController.java, UserService.java, and pom.xml

🔍 STEP 4: Check what changed

Run:

git status


You’ll see something like:

modified: src/main/java/com/crm/controller/UserController.java
modified: src/main/java/com/crm/service/UserService.java

➕ STEP 5: Stage your changes

Add only the files you want to commit:

git add .


or selectively:

git add src/main/java/com/crm/controller/UserController.java


Now check again:

git status


You’ll see:

Changes to be committed:
  modified: UserController.java
  modified: UserService.java

🧾 STEP 6: Commit your changes

Write a meaningful commit message (use short, clear messages):

git commit -m "feat: add user creation and listing APIs"


✅ Tip:

feat: → new feature

fix: → bug fix

refactor: → code cleanup

chore: → config/build change

🚀 STEP 7: Push your branch to GitHub

Push your committed changes to remote branch:

git push origin user-management


Now your remote branch (origin/user-management) has the latest code.

🌐 STEP 8: Create a Pull Request (PR)

Go to GitHub → your repository → “Pull Requests” → “New Pull Request”.

Set:

Base: main
Compare: user-management


GitHub shows your changes and commits.
Add title and description, e.g.:

Title: feat: add user management module

Description:
- Added user CRUD operations
- Implemented validation
- Tested endpoints using Postman


Click Create Pull Request.

👀 STEP 9: Review + Merge

Your teammate (or you, if solo) reviews the PR.
If everything is fine → click Merge pull request → Confirm.

This merges your work into main.

🧹 STEP 10: Clean up

Once merged, delete your old branch (on GitHub or locally):

git branch -d user-management
git push origin --delete user-management

🔄 STEP 11: Sync your local main again

Now update your main branch with the latest merged code:

git checkout main
git pull origin main


✅ Your main branch is now up to date with all changes.

🧠 DAILY WORKFLOW SUMMARY
Step	Command	Purpose
1️⃣	git checkout main && git pull origin main	Sync with latest main
2️⃣	git checkout -b user-management	Create or switch to your feature branch
3️⃣	(Edit code)	Add/modify files
4️⃣	git add .	Stage changes
5️⃣	git commit -m "feat: add user management APIs"	Commit work
6️⃣	git push origin user-management	Push to remote branch
7️⃣	(On GitHub) Create Pull Request	Request to merge into main
8️⃣	Review + Merge	Integrate into main
9️⃣	git checkout main && git pull origin main	Update local main
🔟	git branch -d user-management	Cleanup old branch
⚙️ Example Real Use Case (You + Teammate)
Person	Branch	Task	Merges Into
You	user-management	Backend User APIs	main
Teammate	lead-management	Lead tracking module	main

Both create separate PRs → both merge into main → both pull main after every merge.
